## Overview

Organizations struggle to query data across multiple domains and data sources, requiring deep SQL expertise and knowledge of complex data schemas. **Databricks Unified Chat** solves this by providing an intelligent multi-agent system that routes natural language queries to the appropriate data sources, synthesizes results, and delivers comprehensive answers.

Built on LangGraph, Databricks Genie and Lakebase, this solution enables business users to ask questions spanning multiple data domains without needing to understand the underlying data architecture or write complex SQL queries.

> ### Why use DBX-UnifiedChat?
- **Accuracy of Answer** 
    - Validated with customers and partners, e.g., tumor outcome data analysis.
- **Explanation and Curation** 
    - Results are curated and explained by SQL answer returned and associated explanations.
- **Speed**
    - Optimized with parallel/cache/token reduction/architecture design
    - Achieves 1-2 seconds TTFT
    - For complex query across domains, we see it achieves 1/3 to 1/2 of the time of the No/Low-Code custom agent solution.



## Architecture

![Agent Architecture](docs/architecture/architecture_diagram_simple_v2.png)

The system uses a multi-agent architecture powered by LangGraph:

* **Supervisor Agent (multi-purpose)** - Frontend agent that orchestrates the workflow and coordinates handoffs to other agents
* **Thinking & Planning Agent** - Analyzes queries and creates execution plans based on the query intent and context
* **Genie Agents** - Query individual Genie spaces for domain-specific data
* **SQL Synthesis Agent (table route)** - Combines and synthesizes SQL across table data sources using UC Functions (instructed retrieval)
* **SQL Synthesis Agent (genie route)** - Combines and synthesizes SQL across genie space data sources using Genie agents as tools (parallel execution)
* **SQL Execution Agent** - Executes queries and extracts results
* **Summarize Agent** - Summarizes results and formats responses for the user

The system leverages:
* **LangGraph** for agent orchestration and workflow management
* **LangChain** for agent tools and integrations
* **Lakebase** for state management and long/short-term memory
* **Databricks Genie** as Agent/Tool for natural language to SQL conversion
* **UC Functions** as Tools for multi-step instructed retrieval
* **Databricks SDK** for Databricks platform integration
* **Databricks SQL Warehouse** for query execution
* **Model Serving** for model deployment and serving
* **MLflow** for Agent observability, evaluation and model tracking
* **Pydantic** for data validation and configuration
* **Pytest** for testing framework
* **PyYAML** for configuration management
* **Vector Search** for semantic metadata retrieval
* **Unity Catalog** for data governance and metadata management

### Key Technologies Applied:

* **Multi-turn Chatting** - Supports clarification, continue, refine, and new question flows for conversational interactions
* **Meta-question Fast Route** - Optimized path for handling meta-questions about the system itself
* **Multi-step Instructed Retrieval** - Advanced retrieval strategy in table route with step-by-step instructions
* **Parallel GenieAgent Tool Calls** - Concurrent execution of multiple Genie agents for improved performance in Genie route
* **Lakebase with Long/Short-term Memory** - Persistent memory management for maintaining context across conversations

See [Architecture Documentation](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed design.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10 or higher
* Node.js 18 or higher
* `uv`, `npm`, `jq`, and Databricks CLI
* Databricks workspace with:
  * Genie spaces configured
  * SQL Warehouse configured
  * Permissions to deploy Databricks Asset Bundles and Databricks Apps

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/databricks-solutions/dbx-unifiedchat.git
cd dbx-unifiedchat
```

### Recommended Workflow

#### 1. Deploy metadata prerequisites from the root bundle

Deploy the root-level Databricks Asset Bundle first, then run the ETL job defined in `resources/etl_pipeline.yml`. This is the prerequisite for both local testing and deployed app environments because it creates the metadata artifacts and vector index the agent relies on.

```bash
databricks bundle validate
databricks bundle deploy
databricks bundle run etl_pipeline
```

Use `-t prod` for the production target when needed.

#### 2. Deploy the app and agent from `agent_app`

The active deployment path is now the Databricks App in `agent_app/`.

```bash
cd agent_app
./scripts/deploy.sh --run
```

Useful options:

* `./scripts/deploy.sh --target prod --run`
* `./scripts/deploy.sh --profile <profile> --run`
* `./scripts/deploy.sh --sync --run`

#### 3. Local app development in `agent_app`

Use the bootstrap/build script once, then use hot reload for normal development.

```bash
cd agent_app

# One-time local bootstrap/build
./scripts/dev-local.sh

# Iterative development with hot reload
./scripts/dev-local-hot-reload.sh
```

Useful options:

* `./scripts/dev-local.sh --profile <profile>`
* `./scripts/dev-local-hot-reload.sh --profile <profile>`
* `./scripts/dev-local-hot-reload.sh --skip-migrate`

#### 4. Legacy model serving path

The old Model Serving agent flow is deprecated. The related code still exists in the repo for now, but the supported deployment model is the Databricks App under `agent_app/`.
