## Title: OneChat for Customers - Cross-Domain Q&A Multi-Agent System

---

## 1. Problem Statement or Opportunity Statement

**Problem:**

Customers are currently stuck asking questions to one Genie room at a time. Existing solutions including **Agent Bricks MAS** and the **Multi-Genie tutorial** ([notebook](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/generative-ai/agent-framework/multi-agent-genie)) are not meeting customer requirements, creating significant limitations in their data analysis workflow:

### Current Pain Points:

1. **Siloed Data Access**: Users must know exactly which Genie space contains the data they need before asking questions. This requires deep organizational knowledge and creates friction in the discovery process.

2. **Competitive Disadvantage**: We are competing with **Collibra** and **Snowflake** as we don't have a robust solution yet for Q&A based on hundreds of tables in their workspace (grouped in Genie rooms or not). This represents a critical market gap that puts Databricks at a disadvantage.

3. **Manual Query Orchestration**: When analysis requires data from multiple domains (e.g., patient demographics + pharmacy claims + medical procedures), users must:
   - Query each Genie space separately
   - Manually copy results
   - Manually join or combine data in external tools (Excel, notebooks)
   - Repeat the process if results are unclear

4. **Limited Cross-Domain Intelligence**: Complex business questions like "What is the average cost of claims for diabetic patients by insurance type and age group?" span multiple data domains but cannot be answered in a single conversation round with existing Genie spaces. A multi-agent system with sub-agent specialty and cost-efficiency is the potential solution.

5. **Context Loss**: Users lose conversation context when switching between Genie rooms, requiring them to re-explain requirements and repeat clarifications.

6. **Inefficient Knowledge Discovery**: Without a unified interface, users spend significant time:
   - Discovering which Genie spaces are relevant to their question
   - Understanding relationships between different data domains
   - Trial-and-error to find the right combination of queries

7. **Incomplete Metadata Infrastructure**: Current approach lacks an integral and systematic method to enrich table/column metadata, such as:
   - Sample values of columns
   - Categorical distributions of columns
   - Combined retrieval of Genie room metadata including Genie instructions (text/sql/join/expressions) for agent processing

8. **Inefficient Metadata Utilization**: The existing approach to querying available metadata is suboptimal:
   - Metadata is lumped into a Vector Search index relying solely on RAG
   - No intelligent routing or incremental instructed information retrieval
   - Metadata is dumped to a single agent without cherrypicking the most relevant information
   - No structured approach to match query intent with relevant metadata (e.g., if the user is asking about a specific column, the agent should not dump all the metadata for all columns)

9. **No Feedback Loop Integration**: Missing comprehensive feedback system for:
   - Multi-agent system as a whole
   - Individual agent performance at each workflow step
   - Underlying Genie space quality and accuracy
   - **Critical gap**: How to design UI and MLflow integration to collect user feedback holistically and per step of the workflow
   - **Missed opportunity**: Cannot leverage evaluation and iteration loops to improve both the agent system and underlying Genie spaces
   - **Forward learning**: No mechanism to automatically forward learnings (e.g., user thumbs-up feedback) directly to Genie spaces as instructions for continuous improvement

### Opportunity:

Create a unified, intelligent multi-agent system that:
- Automatically identifies relevant data sources across all Genie spaces
- Orchestrates complex cross-domain queries in a single conversation
- Provides transparent reasoning and execution plans
- Maintains conversation context and learns from clarifications
- Enables true self-service analytics for complex business questions

---

## 2. Proposed Solution

### **OneChat: An Intelligent Multi-Agent Q&A System**

OneChat is a sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system that enables users to ask complex cross-domain questions in natural language and receive comprehensive answers by intelligently coordinating multiple Genie spaces and data sources.

### Core Architecture:

**5-Agent Orchestration System:**

1. **Clarification Agent**
   - Validates query clarity before execution
   - Asks targeted clarification questions (max once per conversation)
   - Provides contextual options based on available data
   - Prevents wasted computation on ambiguous queries

2. **Planning Agent**
   - Uses Vector Search to identify relevant Genie spaces across all domains
   - Creates intelligent execution plans for cross-domain queries
   - Determines optimal query strategy (table_route vs. genie_route)
   - Automatically identifies when data joins are needed

3. **SQL Synthesis Agent (Dual-Route)**
   - **Table Route**: Direct SQL generation using Unity Catalog functions for single-domain or simple join queries
   - **Genie Route**: Coordinates multiple Genie agents for complex cross-domain analysis, combining partial queries intelligently
   - Extracts metadata, table schemas, and column details dynamically
   - Generates optimized SQL with proper joins and aggregations

4. **SQL Execution Agent**
   - Executes generated SQL queries on Delta tables
   - Returns structured results with metadata
   - Includes execution plans for transparency
   - Handles errors gracefully with detailed feedback

5. **Result Summarization Agent**
   - Generates natural language summaries of findings
   - Provides comprehensive final messages including:
     - Execution summary and success status
     - Generated SQL with explanations
     - Query results displayed as interactive DataFrames
     - Execution plans and routing strategy used
     - Error details if any failures occurred

### Key Technical Innovations:

**1. Hybrid Architecture Pattern (Novel Approach)**
- **Innovation**: Combines OOP agent classes (modularity) with explicit TypedDict state management (observability)
- **Why it matters**: Traditional approaches sacrifice either modularity (functional agents) or observability (OOP-only). We achieved both.
- **Implementation**:
  ```
  Node Wrapper Pattern:
  Planning Node → PlanningAgent (OOP) → Explicit State Update
  ↓ Benefits:
  - Agent classes testable independently
  - Full state visibility at every step
  - Easy to swap implementations
  ```
- **Comparison**:
  - Agent.py (OOP only): ✅ Modularity, ❌ State observability
  - Super_Agent.py (Functions): ❌ Modularity, ✅ State observability
  - **OneChat (Hybrid)**: ✅ Modularity, ✅ Observability, ✅ Production-ready

**2. Intelligent Space Discovery with Semantic Vector Search**
- **Innovation**: Vector Search over enriched Genie space metadata with selective retrieval
- **Enrichment pipeline**:
  - Table/column metadata extraction
  - Sample values and categorical distributions
  - Business context and relationships
  - Searchable content generation
- **Smart retrieval**:
  - Semantic similarity matching (top-K relevant spaces)
  - Automatic filtering and ranking
  - Token-optimized metadata (removed 90% waste)
  - Only fetch searchable_content when actually needed by agents

**3. Systematic Metadata Enrichment Infrastructure**
- **Innovation**: Comprehensive table/column metadata beyond basic schemas
- **Enriched metadata includes**:
  - Sample values for understanding data patterns
  - Categorical distributions for understanding domains
  - Data quality metrics (completeness, uniqueness)
  - Business glossary terms and descriptions
  - Relationships between tables and Genie spaces
- **Structured storage**: Delta tables with versioning for metadata evolution
- **Intelligent indexing**: Vector Search indexes only relevant metadata fields
- **Why it matters**: Solves the "metadata lump sum" problem - agents get precisely what they need

**4. Dual-Route Intelligent Query Orchestration**
- **Innovation**: Automatic detection and routing based on query complexity
- **Table Route** (3-5 seconds):
  - Direct SQL generation using UC Function Toolkit
  - For single-domain or simple multi-domain queries
  - Uses: `get_table_overview`, `get_column_detail`, `get_space_summary`
- **Genie Route** (5-10 seconds):
  - Coordinates multiple Genie agents in parallel
  - Each Genie agent provides partial SQL + reasoning
  - SQL Synthesis agent intelligently combines with proper JOINs/CTEs
  - For complex cross-domain queries requiring deep context
- **Decision logic**:
  ```
  If (metadata_sufficient AND requires_simple_join):
      → Table Route (UC tools)
  Elif (requires_genie_context OR user_requests_slow):
      → Genie Route (multi-Genie coordination)
  ```
- **Cost optimization**: Table_route uses cheaper models (Haiku), genie_route uses Sonnet only when needed

**5. Advanced State Management with Full Observability**
- **Innovation**: Explicit TypedDict with 20+ tracked fields for complete workflow transparency
- **Key tracked state**:
  - Query lifecycle: `original_query`, `question_clear`, `clarification_needed`
  - Planning: `execution_plan`, `relevant_spaces`, `join_strategy`
  - Synthesis: `sql_query`, `sql_synthesis_explanation`, `has_sql`
  - Execution: `execution_result`, `row_count`, `columns`
  - Errors: `synthesis_error`, `execution_error`
  - Summary: `final_summary`
- **Benefits**:
  - Full state inspection at any workflow point
  - Easy debugging with explicit field access
  - MLflow tracing captures complete state transitions
  - Type safety with IDE support

**6. Token Optimization Strategy (90% Reduction)**
- **Innovation**: Selective metadata inclusion based on agent needs
- **Before**: 2000-5000 tokens per planning prompt (all metadata dumped)
- **After**: 200-500 tokens per planning prompt (only space_id + space_title)
- **Techniques**:
  - Removed `searchable_content` from planning prompts
  - Only include when Genie agents need description
  - Efficient prompt engineering
  - Configurable max_tokens per agent (2000 for summaries)
- **Cost impact**: ~90% reduction in planning/state tokens = significant cost savings at scale

**7. Comprehensive Feedback Loop Architecture (Future-Ready)**
- **Innovation**: Multi-level feedback collection integrated with MLflow
- **Feedback levels**:
  - Workflow-level: Overall satisfaction with final answer
  - Agent-level: Thumbs up/down at each step (clarification, planning, SQL, execution)
  - Genie-level: Quality of individual Genie space responses
- **UI Integration** (designed):
  - Databricks Playground integration with step-by-step feedback UI
  - MLflow experiment tracking for A/B testing
  - User feedback as MLflow metrics
- **Learning loop** (designed):
  - Aggregate feedback → Identify improvement areas
  - Automatic prompt refinement for agents
  - Forward positive feedback to Genie spaces as instructions
  - Continuous evaluation and iteration
- **Why critical**: Closes the loop between user satisfaction and system improvement

**8. Production-Grade Infrastructure**
- **MLflow tracing**: All agent calls, state transitions, and LLM invocations tracked
- **Databricks Model Serving**: ResponsesAgent interface with streaming support
- **Unity Catalog integration**: 4+ UC functions as tools, reusable across org
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation at every step, detailed error messages
- **Conversation continuity**: Thread-based MemorySaver with unique thread_id per session
- **Streaming responses**: Real-time feedback to users during long-running queries

**9. Smart Message Management with SystemMessage Context**
- **Innovation**: SystemMessage initialization provides consistent agent behavior
- **Message flow**:
  ```
  Thread Start:
  [SystemMessage: "You are a multi-agent Q&A system..."]
  [HumanMessage: User query]
  [AIMessage: Clarification response]
  [HumanMessage: User clarification]
  [AIMessage: Planning analysis]
  [AIMessage: SQL Synthesis explanation]
  [AIMessage: Comprehensive final summary]
  ```
- **Benefits**:
  - All agents see same system context
  - Conversation history preserved across turns
  - Explicit message attribution (Human vs AI)
  - Better LLM performance with clear role instructions

---

#### **2. Agent Bricks MAS (Third-Party Solution)**

**What it is:**
- Third-party multi-agent system framework
- Generic approach to agent orchestration
- Attempts to coordinate multiple data sources

**What it does:**
- Provides multi-agent coordination framework
- Some level of orchestration between agents
- Basic integration with data sources

**Limitations:**
- ❌ **Generic approach**: Not optimized for Databricks/Genie specifically

**Why it's insufficient:**
Generic multi-agent framework not purpose-built for Databricks ecosystem. Lacks deep integration with Genie, UC functions, and Databricks-specific optimizations.

---

#### **3. Individual Genie Spaces (Current Core Solution)**

**What it does:**
- Provides conversational Q&A interface for specific data domains
- Generates SQL for single-table or single-domain queries
- Offers guided data exploration within a bounded context

**Limitations:**
- ❌ **Single-domain only**: Cannot answer questions requiring data from multiple Genie spaces
- ❌ **No cross-domain joins**: Users must manually combine results from different spaces
- ❌ **Context isolation**: No memory or context sharing between spaces
- ❌ **Manual orchestration required**: Users must know which space to query
- ❌ **No intelligent routing**: Cannot automatically discover relevant data sources

**Why it's insufficient:**
Complex business questions inherently span multiple domains. For example, "Which high-cost diabetes patients are on generic vs. brand-name medications by age group?" requires patient demographics, medical claims, and pharmacy data - impossible to answer within a single Genie space.

---

#### **4. Manual SQL Development**

**What it does:**
- Data analysts write SQL queries directly in notebooks or SQL editors
- Full control over joins, filters, and aggregations
- Can query across multiple tables and domains

### Key Gaps OneChat Addresses:

1. **Intelligent Multi-Domain Orchestration**: Unlike any existing solution, OneChat automatically discovers and coordinates multiple data sources for cross-domain questions.

2. **Specialized Agent Architecture**: Rather than a single agent trying to do everything, OneChat uses specialized agents (clarification, planning, SQL synthesis, execution, summarization) for optimal performance.

3. **Transparent Reasoning**: Shows execution plans, SQL queries, and routing decisions - unlike black-box BI tools or opaque single agents.

4. **Conversation Continuity**: Maintains context across multiple turns with thread-based memory - not available in dashboards or individual Genie spaces.

5. **Production-Grade Observability**: Full MLflow integration, explicit state tracking, comprehensive error handling - beyond typical proof-of-concept agent systems.

6. **Dual-Route Intelligence**: Automatically chooses between fast (direct SQL) and slow (multi-Genie coordination) routes based on query complexity - unique capability.

---

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:

**The Core Problem:** Cross-domain data analysis requires:
1. Understanding which data sources are relevant (discovery)
2. Planning how to combine them (orchestration)
3. Generating correct SQL with proper joins (synthesis)
4. Executing and interpreting results (execution + summarization)

**No existing solution handles all four steps intelligently and automatically.**

- **Genie spaces**: ✅ Execution + Summarization, ❌ Discovery + Orchestration
- **BI tools**: ✅ Execution (pre-modeled), ❌ Discovery + Orchestration + Dynamic synthesis
- **Single agents**: ⚠️ All four but poorly, lacks specialization and intelligence

**OneChat is the first solution to combine:**
- Multi-agent specialization (each agent expert in its domain)
- Intelligent orchestration (automatic discovery and routing)
- Natural language interface (true self-service)
- Production-grade infrastructure (enterprise-ready)

This represents a **genuine innovation gap** in the market for cross-domain data analysis.

#### **7. Feedback Loop Infrastructure (Future-Ready Design)**

**Architecture for Continuous Improvement:**

**a) Multi-Level Feedback Collection**
```
User Interaction Layer:
  ├─ Workflow-level thumbs up/down (overall satisfaction)
  ├─ Step-level feedback (clarification, planning, SQL, execution)
  └─ Genie-level feedback (individual space quality)
```

**b) UI Integration Design**
- **Databricks AI Playground Integration**:
  - Step-by-step feedback buttons at each agent output
  - "Was this clarification helpful?" after Clarification Agent
  - "Was the execution plan clear?" after Planning Agent
  - "Was the SQL correct?" after SQL Synthesis
  - "Were the results accurate?" after Execution
  - Overall satisfaction survey after final summary

- **MLflow Experiment Tracking**:
  - Each feedback logged as MLflow metric
  - Feedback tied to specific run_id and trace_id
  - Aggregate metrics: satisfaction_rate, accuracy_rate, clarification_effectiveness
  - A/B testing support: Compare feedback across prompt versions

**c) Learning Loop Implementation**
```python
# Feedback collection
feedback = {
    "thread_id": "user_session_001",
    "run_id": mlflow_run_id,
    "workflow_feedback": {
        "overall_satisfaction": "thumbs_up",
        "rating": 4.5,
        "comment": "Great answer!"
    },
    "agent_feedback": {
        "clarification_agent": "thumbs_up",
        "planning_agent": "thumbs_up",
        "sql_synthesis_agent": "thumbs_up",
        "sql_execution_agent": "thumbs_up"
    },
    "genie_feedback": {
        "space_id_1": "thumbs_up",
        "space_id_2": "thumbs_down",  # This space needs improvement
        "space_id_3": "thumbs_up"
    }
}

# Log to MLflow
mlflow.log_metrics({
    "overall_satisfaction": 1.0,  # thumbs_up = 1.0
    "clarification_effectiveness": 1.0,
    "sql_accuracy": 1.0
})
mlflow.log_params({
    "user_query": query,
    "spaces_used": ["space_1", "space_2", "space_3"],
    "route_taken": "table_route"
})
```

**d) Automatic Prompt Refinement**
- **Aggregate feedback analysis**:
  - Identify agents with low satisfaction scores
  - Analyze patterns in thumbs-down feedback
  - Correlate with query types and spaces

- **Iterative improvement**:
  - Generate prompt variations for low-performing agents
  - A/B test new prompts against baseline
  - Automatically promote high-performing prompts
  - Track improvement over time

**e) Forward Learning to Genie Spaces**
```python
# When user gives thumbs up to a query result
if workflow_feedback == "thumbs_up" and sql_execution_successful:
    # Extract learnings
    learning = {
        "user_query": original_query,
        "generated_sql": sql_query,
        "execution_plan": execution_plan,
        "success": True
    }
    
    # Forward to relevant Genie spaces as positive examples
    for space_id in relevant_space_ids:
        genie_space.add_instruction(
            instruction=f"For queries like '{original_query}', use pattern: {execution_plan}",
            example_sql=sql_query,
            validation_status="user_approved"
        )
```

**f) Evaluation Metrics Dashboard**
- **Real-time monitoring**: Satisfaction rate, query success rate, latency
- **Trend analysis**: Improvement over time per agent and Genie space
- **Error pattern detection**: Common failure modes, areas needing improvement
- **User segmentation**: Performance by user role, query type, data domain

**g) Continuous Iteration Cycle**
```
Week 1-2: Launch + baseline metrics collection
Week 3-4: First iteration based on feedback
    ↓
Analyze aggregate feedback → Identify low-performing components
    ↓
Generate prompt improvements → A/B test variations
    ↓
Promote winning variations → Forward learnings to Genie
    ↓
Monitor improvement → Repeat cycle
```

**Why This Matters:**

This comprehensive feedback loop design addresses Pain Point #9 and creates a self-improving system that:
- **Gets better with usage**: More queries = more feedback = better performance
- **Targets improvements**: Focus on specific agents or Genie spaces that need help
- **Validates changes**: A/B testing ensures improvements are real
- **Closes the loop**: Learnings flow back to Genie spaces to improve them too
- **Provides transparency**: Users see that their feedback creates tangible improvements
